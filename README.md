# A .NET symphony with C sharp

## Preface

Nowadays, it's easier than in the 70s and 80s to get into programming and try to solve issues that you may have at home org at work. Instead of having a limited number of books that are our holy grail on programming and having to go to a computer labs to try and code something, we can do all of this in the comfort of our homes. We have access to an incredibly rich amount of information thanks to the internet with _Youtube_ videos, books on _Amazon_, blogs and so on. There aren't just 1 or 2 programming languages, as we've progress in time, more and more languages were created. All have there reasons of existence, but it's hard for the neophyte to understand the exact tools to use in order to efficiently solve the problem at hand. Not only the programming language can impact the learning curve, but also the technical environment chosen in order to create and develop the software.

Syntax isn't everything when someone's programming. In fact, syntax are just like the alphabet that one learns in the beginning in order to be able to form the words and the sentences that the computer and the other developers will have to read to understand the train of thought. To organize those trains of thought, we have programming paradigms. \_A paradigm is a way of doing things. It's that simple. Some paradigms are focused on executing actions in a sequential manner, others have a way to organize data into templates that will their definitions and their behaviours. Those templates are call "objects" and that's the mindset of \_object oriented programming. Objects can represent anything from either a physical or virtual space such as a person that will have a name, an age, a weight, be able to speak languages and run to a certain speed for instance. This is a popular paradigm that is being taught in school and widely used in the industry.

There are many programming languages that will enable you, as a software developer, to organize your code using object oriented programming. This paradigm is also known as OOP and I will use both terms in this book when talking about the paradigm.

## About this book

Right now, you embarking on a new journey. Software development is a world in itself and it is incredibly interesting. You have to understand all the tremendous power you will have acquired after reading this book. I will show you the basics in the books concerning software development. After this, you decide what you want to do. You can decide to only use your newly gained knowledge to automate annoying things that you don't feel like doing over and over. You can use this book as a stepping stone for a career as computer science student or software engineering student and focus on subjects that were cover briefly in this book. You should take this book as an entry point into programming projects you'd like to tackle.

## Who should read this book

This for book is aim for people who have absolutely no knowledge of programming, we're here to learn about how to structure our train of thought with OOP and C\#. You will get to learn rudimentary and intermediate concepts concerning coding and C\# such as polymorphism, TDD, design patterns, etc. If you're an experience developer, you can use this book in order to pick up C\# quickly.

# How this book is organized

As mentioned before, I will show the basics of software development with C\#. I firmly believe that you get to understand more about what you learn by doing. With that idea in mind, the book will also have projects. Each section concerning projects will introduce the purpose of the project and what you get to learn while building it alongside the book. For instance, you will be able to build both a web and mobile applications amongst the projects in the book.

The first part of the book will introduce the syntax and oriented object programming with C\# and we'll then move to a how to build our very own todo list console application. In the second part of the book, I will show you C\# features in order to have a clean logic while writing iteration statement and how to test your code to increase maintainability of your code. In the third and final section of the book, you will create a web app, a desktop app and a mobile application. All with C\#. You will also get to learn some helpful tips and tricks concerning gotchas and features of C\#.
